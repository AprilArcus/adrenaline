# Adrenaline

This was started as a pack of tools for Redux to work with GraphQL (before Relay release) but have transformed into a Relay-like framework. Motivation: I do not like Relay in most cases and want to share the same idea with defferent more clean API.

## Status

Currently I'm working hard for the 1.0 release which gonna be public. If anyone want to help please note me in issues.

## Todo:
 - query batching
 - fieldASTs memoization to reduce overhead for query parsing
 - move all query sending into Adrenaline component
 - do we ever need SmartComponents?
